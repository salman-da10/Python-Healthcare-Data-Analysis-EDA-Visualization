# 7-Day Python Data Analysis & Visualization Repository 🐍

This repository contains 20 Python exercises focused on Healthcare dataset analysis.
The tasks are organized progressively into:
- **Basic**
-**Intermediate**
- **Advanced**
- **Visualization Exercises**

It demonstrate how to clean, analyze, and visualize healthcare data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

All exercises are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook / Python scripts inside this repository.

# 📌 Exercises Overview
## Basic Exercises (5 Tasks)

Task 1: Load the dataset and display the first 10 patient records.

Task 2: Show dataset shape, column names, and data types.

Task 3: Filter patients admitted to the Cardiology department.

Task 4: Sort patients by Admission Date.

Task 5: Check for missing values in each column.

## Intermediate Exercises (5 Tasks)

Task 6: Fill missing values in the Age column with the average age.

Task 7: Remove duplicate patient records.

Task 8: Group patients by Diagnosis and count them.

Task 9: Create a new column → Length of Stay = Discharge Date – Admission Date.

Task 10: Convert Admission Date to datetime and extract Month and Year.

## Advanced Exercises (5 Tasks)

Task 11: Identify the Top 5 hospitals with the highest number of patients.

Task 12: Create a Pivot Table showing number of patients per department per month.

Task 13: Generate a Correlation Matrix between Age, Length of Stay, and Charges.

Task 14: Create a Bar Chart of the Top 10 Diagnoses by patient count.

Task 15: Perform Complex EDA: Monthly patient admissions trend (Line Chart).

## Visualization Exercises (5 Tasks)

Task 16: Plot an Age Distribution Histogram to analyze most admitted age groups.

Task 17: Create a Box Plot of hospital charges by department.

Task 18: Generate a Pie Chart of patients by gender (Male/Female/Other).

Task 19: Plot a Line Chart of monthly patient admissions.

Task 20: Create a Heatmap showing correlations between Age, Length of Stay, and Charges.

# 🚀 How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/7day-python-healthcare.git
cd 7day-python-healthcare


# Install Dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Open the notebook or scripts to explore tasks day by day.


# 📝 Notes

The dataset used is healthcare-related (patients, hospitals, admissions, charges).

Tasks are structured progressively, from Basic inspection → Intermediate cleaning → Advanced analysis → Visualization.

All exercises use Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.

Datasets are also provided inside the repository in a separate dataset folder.

You can replace the dataset with any healthcare dataset that has similar columns (Age, Gender, Diagnosis, Admission Date, Discharge Date, Charges, etc.).
